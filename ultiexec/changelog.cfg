echo "Changelog:"
echo "	V10.4"
echo "	- Moved all required dependecies into a seperate folder for easier"
echo "	  ease of access and updating."
echo "	- Added Master and Voice Volume Controls"
echo "	  Defaults are:" 
echo "	  Up/Down = Master"
echo "	  Left(lower)/Right(higher) = Voice"
echo "	- Seperated Cleanup into its own file. This is for a couple of reasons"
echo "	  Cheif among them being, ease of changes without breaking the overall file"
echo "	  As well as the ability to disable/remove it entirely from the process."
echo "	  There's a number of changes I wanted to attempt that involve the same process"
echo "	  as how the Display Damage Script functions. Thinks the 'communications jammed'"
echo "	  without saying that in Team Chat, but to just yourself."
echo "	- Removed Graphics from Autoexec Startup, put them into their own file."
echo "	- Further changes to the sound aspect of things is coming, from notifications to "
echo "	  overall sound settings."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Quick switch will no longer switch back to your primary"
echo "	  weapon (i.e., your AK/M4) when you want to quick switch to knife and back."
echo "	  The reasoning behind this is a few things:"
echo "	  some people have a (bad, myself included^*) habit of quick switching on our reloads"
echo "	  cause of older games or "Pro."  
echo "	  This will allow us to do that on pistols without it returning to our primary."
echo "	  Little known fact: When you start to reload in CS, the full sound will play for enemies."
echo "	  **What this means:** You can start to reload an ak, quick switch right after and bait"
echo "	  the enemy in Dust2 upper Tuns whom flashed but isn't pushing. Fuck that guy."
echo "	- **Behavior Change:** Clutch mode no longer alerts your team. This simply avoid the salt"
echo "	  when you have teammates whom question why it's 'Communcations Jammed' and it further detracts"
echo "	  from the game."
echo ""
echo "	  (For those interested, I mentioned it was a bad habit because it was proven to be"
echo "	   ineffective for increasing the speed of a reload to any useful degree. See:"
echo "	   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8S0t2Ep30 "
echo "	   and https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2t641d/does_quick_switching_actually_reduce_reload_time/"
echo "	   A quick way to test would be the FAMAS, it's time would be significantly reduced; but isn't.)
echo ""
echo "	V10.3.1"
echo "	- Fixed Issues with TeamEquipment Implementiontation."
echo "	- Investigating a sound change for the Damage Indicator Script"
echo ""
echo "	- Good Luck, Have fun. "
