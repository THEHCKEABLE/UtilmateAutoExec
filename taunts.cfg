// In concept, this works similarly to the buy binds script. (See buybinds.cfg) 
// Okay, more like; works exactly the same way. 
// If you want the keys to do something other than taunts when pressed,
// (though this seems a bit hard to reach, which is why they were taunts...)
// all you need to do is change the "a" alias command from (at this writing) "unbind *key*"
// to the command, alias, slot, etc. that you'd like it directed to.
