echo "Changelog:"
echo ""
echo "	V10.0"
echo "	- Removed old Buy Binds due to some technical issues"
echo "	  that arose from that sort of buy configuration."
echo "	  E.g. Wasting money on armor that wasn't needed when "
echo "	  trying to replenish nades, etc."
echo "	- Replaced Buy Binds with a new dependecy: buybinds.cfg"
echo "	  This file rebinds 1 through = so buy keys. These buy 
echo "	  certain items. Due to the limit of keys to actual items"
echo "	  in game, I have chosen a few I think you will use most 
echo "	  widely. Feel free to change them as you see fit."
echo "	- Fixed some general formatting inside of the AutoExec"
echo "	- Bound Function Keys to Slot Keys to fix a 'bug.' "
echo "	  1 THROUGH = STILL WORK AS INTENDED."
echo "	  This is to fix a graphical bug in the HUD caused by CS"
echo "	  when the buy binds."
echo "	- Removed Soul. No longer a required dependecy." 
echo ""
echo "	V9.3"
echo "	- Minor Bug Fixes to Mute Script"
echo ""
echo "	V9.0"
echo "	- Changed the Mute script, it is now infinitely better."
echo "	  The original version simply used voice_enable (as"
echo "	  voice_scale .0 caused popping for myself)"
echo "	  and toggled it on/off. The current version will"
echo "	  now alert your team of your lack of voice and plays"
echo "	  a sound to indicate whether it is on or off."
echo "	  For example: 'I'm still standing boys' is Quiet Mode ON"
echo "	  while Quiet Mode OFF is the 'Area clear'"
echo "	- There is currently a known bug in this script that"
echo "	  causes the off state indication sound to play"
echo "	  at the start of the game. This doesn't seem fixable"
echo "	  for the time being. At least it's cool sounding."
echo "	- Forces V for Voice and Alt for Map"
echo "	- Added unbinds as cleanup for previous version and"
echo "	  to prevent incompatibilty or confusion for either user"
echo "	  or the game itself."
echo "	- Updated Buy Binds, they should now buy items in an"
echo "	  order that means you won't end up with just a gun and nades"
echo "	  if you didn't look at your money prior."
echo "	- Moved Redeploy Key to F2."
echo "	- New insults. Replaced some old ones." 
echo "	- Updated rates."
echo "	- Gaben.cfg is no longer a required dependecy,"
echo "	- commands related to such have been removed."
echo "	- Added Changelog Command, as you can see here."
echo ""
echo "	- Good Luck, Have fun. "
