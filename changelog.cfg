echo "	- Replaced Buy Binds with a new dependecy: buybinds.cfg"
echo "	  This file rebinds 1 through = to buy keys. These buy 
echo "	  certain items. Due to the limit of keys to actual items"
echo "	  in game, I have chosen a few I think you will use most 
echo "	  widely. Feel free to change them as you see fit."
echo "	- Fixed some general formatting inside of the AutoExec"
echo "	- Bound Function Keys to Slot Keys to fix a 'bug.' "
